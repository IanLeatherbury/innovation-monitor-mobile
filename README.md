# InnovationMonitor aka BeerMonitor

This is an IoT project with a mobile front-end. Or a mobile project with an IoT backend. Or a cloud project that ties together a mobile front end and an IoT backend. Either way the mobile app is in the front. I'll leave it to you to decide if the IoT portion is the backend or if the cloud portion is the backend. 

Regardless, this project has the following:

- A Xamarin.Forms Mobile App
- [A Python Raspberry Pi App](https://github.com/IanLeatherbury/innovation-monitor-razzberry-pi)
- [An Azure Function App](https://github.com/IanLeatherbury/innovation-monitor-functions)

The accompanying projects can be found at the links above.
